# A Probabilistic Measure of Multi-Robot Connectivity and Ergodic Optimal Control

## üì¶ Installation  

### Conda Environment Setup  
```bash
# Clone repository  
git clone https://github.com/rap-lab-org/public_pymec  
cd public_pymec 

# Create and activate conda environment (Python 3.12 recommended)  
# Note that the results may vary slightly due to the version of JAX
conda create -n imec -f imec.yml 
conda activate imec  
```
